summary=<p>The code might be the architecture but at some point in time you're going to have to explain how it works, and that's when the whiteboard pens make an appearance. Where do you start though? UML or block diagrams? How much detail should you include? Technology decisions included or omitted?</p></p>Agility is about moving fast and this requires good communication, but it's surprising that many teams find it tricky to effectively communicate the architecture of their software. In this tutorial you'll be asked to design a software system and practice communicating your vision through a series of simple yet effective architecture sketches.</p>
