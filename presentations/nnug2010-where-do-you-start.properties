summary=One of the hardest things about software development is being asked to come up with a design when all you're given is a set of requirements and a blank sheet of paper. Many software teams will dive straight into the code and while this can initially be very productive, the slippery slope of constant refactoring is awaiting those teams that haven't quite found a design that works. Often, a little forethought is all that's needed to get the development process heading in the right direction. So where do you start? This session will answer this question, presenting some simple techniques for tackling software architecture while dispelling the myths about the need for complex tools and big design up front.
