summary=Load testing is an often forgotten and seemingly difficult task that many people shy away from doing. It doesn't have to be this way though, with a basic level of load testing often enough to give you confidence that you've satisfied your performance and scalability requirements. This session will look at load testing a website from a developer's perspective. We'll look at the difference between load testing, stress testing and soak testing along with a hands-on demonstration of an open source load testing tool that you can use to get started. If you're building websites in Java, .NET, PHP or indeed any other programming language, this session will show you how easy it is to load test your website.
