summary=It's a well-known fact that we learn by making mistakes, but why not get a head-start and learn from other people's! The software architecture role involves a depth of technology skills along with a breadth of many other things, including soft skills. Those of us that have driven down Architect Boulevard will know that it's a potted ride and in this session we'll tell you exactly where those pitfalls are. Packed full of real-world advice and quotes from others new to the role, this session will give new and aspiring software architects some solid advice for taking their roles forward.
