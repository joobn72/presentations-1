summary=<p>This session is an interactive introduction to software architecture and what it means to be a software architect. It's aimed at software developers who are looking towards their first software architect role, as well as architects that are new to the role. You will gain:</p>\
<ul>\
<li>An understanding of what it means to be a software architect, and the role's responsibilities.</li>\
<li>An understanding of the trade-offs connected with architectural decisions.</li>\
<li>Some experience of what it feels like to be an architect, including gathering non-functional requirements, determining the drivers for architecture, and defining an architecture.</li>\
<li>An understanding that, as a software architect, it's okay to do some coding.</li>\
</ul>\
<p>Combining presentation, group discussion and group working, throughout the day you'll be solidifying everything you learn by defining the architecture for a small software system. The overall goal is that you can take the experience gained here and apply it to your own projects. No architecture experience required, but software development experience is assumed.</p>
