summary=This session presents an introduction to the Java platform and is aimed at anybody with .NET experience. But wait a minute, this is 2009! Why do this now? More and more enterprise projects are turning away from a single technology stack solution and becoming more heterogeneous in nature. If we as technologists are to survive in this ever-changing industry, we need to put any dogma to one side and expand our horizons. We need to start evaluating technologies on their merits rather than simply writing them off through vendor preferences in order that we can provide real business benefit to the stakeholders. As .NET developers, this is your opportunity to get a jump-start into the world of the Java platform, where we'll be taking a look at a number of different APIs, libraries and frameworks, drawing parallels to the .NET framework where applicable.
