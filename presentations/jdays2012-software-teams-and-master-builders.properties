summary=Applying the building metaphor to software doesn't necessarily work, although in medieval times the people that architected buildings were the select few that made into the exclusive society of master builders. The clue here is in the name and a master builder really was a master of their craft. Once elevated to this status though, did the master builder continue to build or was that task left to those less noble? Fast-forward several hundred years and it seems we're asking the same question. Join us as we look at how master builders fit into our modern world of software development.
