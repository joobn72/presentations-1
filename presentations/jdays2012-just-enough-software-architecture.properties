summary=One of the major points of disagreement about software relates to how much up front design to do, with people being very polarised as to when they should do design and how much they should do. "Just enough" sits somewhere in the chasm between big design up front and what often ends up being "foolishly hoping for the best". This session will discuss "just enough" and present a minimal set of software architecture activities that can help drive software projects towards a successful conclusion.
