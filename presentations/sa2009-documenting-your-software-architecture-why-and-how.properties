summary=A description of your software architecture is essential for any project of any size, explaining the rationale behind the design decisions and how the software will work in the real world. Such descriptions should include an explanation of the software structure, the architectural principles adopted, the constraints in force, the platforms on which the system is deployed and an explicit justification of how the architecture satisfies the requirements. A good software architecture document should describe what the code itself doesn't. This session will tell you how to do this.
