summary=<p>The agile and software craftsmanship movements are pushing up the quality of the software systems we build, but there's more we can do because even a small amount of software architecture can prevent many of the problems that projects still face, particularly if the team seems to be more chaotic than they are self-organising. Successful software projects aren't just about good code and sometimes you need to step away from the IDE for a few moments to see the bigger picture. This session is about that bigger picture, software architecture, technical leadership and the balance with agility.</p>
