summary=Designing software given a vague set of requirements and a blank sheet of paper is a good skill to have, although not many people get to do this on a daily basis. However, with agile methods encouraging collective ownership of the code, it's really important that everybody on the team understands the big picture. And in order to do this, you need to understand why you've arrived at the design that you have. In a nutshell, everybody on the team needs to be a software architect. This tutorial will show you what "just enough"up front design is, how it can be applied to your software projects, and how to communicate the big picture through a collection of simple lightweight diagrams. Join us for a mixture of presentation, discussion and deliberate practice.
