summary=The words "agile" and "architecture" are often seen as mutually exclusive but the real world is starting to tell a different story. Some software teams do see architecture as an unnecessary evil whereas others are coming to the conclusion that they do need to think about architecture once again. After all, even the most agile of software projects will have some architectural concerns and these things really should be thought about up front. Agile software projects therefore do need "architecture", but this seems to conflict with how agile has been evangelised for the past 10 years. This session will look at the conflict between agile and architecture in the context of the software development process and how the software architecture role fits into agile teams.
