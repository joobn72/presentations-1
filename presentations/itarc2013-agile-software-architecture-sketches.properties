summary=<p>Agility is about moving fast and this requires good communication, but it's surprising that many teams find it tricky to effectively communicate the architecture of their software. We have the Unified Modelling Language (UML), a formal standardised notation for communicating the design of software systems, but many people favour informal boxes and lines style sketches instead.</p><p>The problem is that such diagrams rarely make any sense and usually need a narrative to accompany them which ultimately slow the team down.</p><ul><li>Agile vs. architectural design - the challenge</li><li>Abandoning UML - and loosing the ability communicate visually?</li><li>Patterns and anti-patterns related to using boxes</li><li>Agile ways of communicating design of software</li></ul>
