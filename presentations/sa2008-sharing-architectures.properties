summary=The transition from architectural vision to production code is not always an easy one. Of course we plan for a certain amount of change and accept that some decisions will, on occasion, be wrong. However, without effective communication of the architecture and timely feed- back mechanisms, can we really expect to see software that we recognise?
Whether weâ€™re up to our elbows in an agile team or riding a barrel down a waterfall project, our choice of what we define and how we convey it can have an enormous bearing on how the architecture is reflected in the software. This session takes a look at some techniques for sharing the architecture and not just publishing it.
