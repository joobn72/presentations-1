summary=<p>Software architecture plays a pivotal role in the delivery of successful software yet it's frustratingly neglected by many teams. Whether performed by one person or shared amongst the team, the architecture role exists on even the smallest and most agile of teams yet the balance of up front and evolutionary thinking often reflects aspiration rather than reality.
