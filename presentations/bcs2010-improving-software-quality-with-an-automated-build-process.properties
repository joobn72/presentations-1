summary=This session will look at the development processes in use for an ASP.NET application, where quality and consistency have a direct effect on the reputation of the organisation. Weâ€™ll look at: Subversion and our use of code branches to manage release complexity; Visual Studio and the add-ins we use on a daily basis; NUnit and our strategies for achieving over 90% code coverage through a combination of automated unit, integration and load testing; NAnt and how it allows us to build, test and release code from any of our development branches in an automated and repeatable way; CruiseControl.NET and how it performs continuous integration and testing on all of our development branches.
