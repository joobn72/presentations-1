summary=<p>Software architecture is a discipline steeped in academia and subsequently feels inaccessible to many software developers. Iâ€™ve been distilling the essence of software architecture over the past few years, helping software teams to understand and introduce it into the way that they work. But what about me? Do I eat my own dog food? Join me to hear about my minimal set of software architecture practices and how I apply them in the real world to take an idea through to working software.</p>
