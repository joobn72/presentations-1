summary=<p>The industry has a love/hate relationship with the Software Architect role, with many organisations dismissing it because of their negative experiences of architects that dictate from ivory towers and aren't engaged with the actual task of building working software. This reputation is damaging the IT industry and inhibiting project success. Things need to change. This session looks at some of the reasons why software projects fail, and presents the view that a good, hands-on software architect can be invaluable in addressing these issues and driving the project to a successful conclusion. Software architects are here to help, not to hinder.</p>
