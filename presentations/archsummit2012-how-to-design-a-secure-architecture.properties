<p>Security is an important quality attribute of most, if not all, software systems regardless of whether the security requirements are explicitly given to you. Security is about much more than the traditional authentication and authorisation concerns though, which means that anybody undertaking the software architecture role needs to have a basic knowledge of security across a number of different perspectives. This session will look at security from a holistic point of view and provide guidance on how to tackle security requirements across your software architecture; from development right through to deployment and operation.</p>
