summary=<p>The agile and software craftsmanship movements are helping to push up the quality of the software systems that we build. Together they are helping us to deliver better software that better meets the needs of the business while carefully managing time and budgetary constraints. But there's still more we can do because even a small amount of software architecture can help prevent many of the problems that projects face, particularly if the team seems to be more chaotic than they are self-organising. Successful software projects aren't just about good code and sometimes you need to step away from the IDE for a few moments to see the bigger picture. This session is about that bigger picture and is aimed at software developers that want to learn more about software architecture and its role in delivering better software. Join us for a guide to software architecture on modern software projects that's pragmatic rather than academic and lightweight rather than "enterprisey".</p>
