summary=<p>The budget has been secured and a team of software developers that know the latest in cutting edge technology has been hired. According to what you'll hear from the evangelists, it's a simple matter of letting the developers self-organise and the software will be ready before you can say "minimum viable product". Back to the real world and if it really was that easy you probably wouldn't be attending this conference. So why are some software teams really successful while others are less than stellar? Well it really is all about the people, stupid. In this talk I'll share some stories from my experience of working with a number of software development teams. Some of those teams were great ... and then there were the others. Prepare to be horrified and amused in equal measure. Continuous improvement is only achievable if you have sustainable competence!</p>
