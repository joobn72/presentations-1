summary=<p>The term "Legacy System" conjures up images of a vast mainframe (with whirring tapes and flashing diodes) running COBOL programs in a basement. However, many current computing stacks are quite old and have many legacy implementations. Although Java/JVM is still at the cutting edge of innovation it's a language and ecosystem that's been around since 1995 (18 years) and C#/.NET is not much younger at 13 years old.</p><p>There are many Java and .NET based systems that haven't been touched in over a decade and this presentation explores some of the issues of upgrading, maintaining or replacing them and provides some pointers on solving common problems.</p>
