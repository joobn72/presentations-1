summary=I regularly run deliberate practice sessions where I ask people to pair up and design a software solution for a given problem before communicating it using pictures. This allows people to experience collaborative software design and to hone their communication skills, as well as being a great way to illustrate what "just enough" up front design is all about.\
<br /><br />\
The same exercise undertaken with your own team can be used contextualise what "just enough" means to you, in terms of both the software design process and communicating it through a collection of lightweight yet effective architecture sketches. But how do you actually do that? This session is about coaching you to coach your team.
