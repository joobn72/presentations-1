summary=<p>Agility is about moving fast and this requires good communication, but it's surprising that many teams struggle to effectively communicate the architecture of their software. We have the Unified Modelling Language (UML), a formal standardised notation for communicating the design of software systems, but many people favour informal boxes and lines style sketches instead. The problem is that such diagrams rarely make any sense, usually need a narrative to accompany them and ultimately slow the team down.</p><p>Abandoning UML is one thing but, in the race for agility, many software development teams have lost the ability to communicate visually. In this workshop you'll be asked to design a software system and practice communicating your vision through a series of simple yet effective software architecture sketches.</p>
